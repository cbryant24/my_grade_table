# Version 0.1

Version 0.1 is the starting point of the Student Grade Table Project. LearningFuze has provided a base structure that
includes HTML structure that will need to be updated with boostrap classes. For this version we are looking to see that you
understand how to style an application with bootstrap, take input values and apply them to objects, and update the DOM
with a visual of those objects stored.
